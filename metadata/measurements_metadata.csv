32 / AF,dup.num,"Assigns a number to every entry in each set of duplicates/replicates, where the integer-part is a unique ID number that groups duplicates and the fractional-part indicates the recommended default order of priority for selecting among duplicates, where higher values indicate higher priority. For values that are replicates or have different measurement dates, all records are assigned the same priority rank. For duplicates, values are assigned in chronological order according to the citation.year. If two sources were published in the same year, the primary source (as opposed to a synthesis) comes first. For duplicates that differ in methodology, higher priority is assigned to the more comprehensive measurement (e.g., including trees + understory as opposed to just trees, sampling roots to greater depth) or that which is generally considered to be more rigorous. When priority was not clear based on the information in the database at the time that ranks were assigned (March 2018), equal values were assigned. A dup.num=0 indicates that no rank was assigned because duplicates were average across multiple years or that records lack the information required to assign a rank.",numeric integer),-,-,17367,0,9
