##Database overview:
The Tropical Forest C database (**TropForC-db**) is the tropical component of ForC-db, which is an open access global C database that is updated and maintained on Github (https://github.com/forc-db). The database consists of a series of cross-referenced data tables describing
(1) sites, (2) plots and their history, (3) measurements of C cycle variables, (4) variables, (5) disturbance/history event type, (6) plant functional types (PFTs)/ species, (7) methodology, and (8)
allometries. A full description of the database and metaadata for all tables is given in `readme_TropForC.pdf`. Data were obtained from multiple previous compilations and individual published studies, as detailed in Anderson-Teixeira et al. (2016). Original citations associated with all data are given in the
measurements table (3), and full citations are in the file `TropForC_bibliography.pdf`. Sample R code, showing how to load the data files into R and join the tables, is provided in a separate file, named
`TropForC_Rcode.txt`. 

##Data Use: 
ForC-db is an open access database, and we encourage use of the data for scientific research and educational purposes. All users are responsible to adhere to the data use policy: `DATA USE POLICY.md` (https://github.com/forc-db/TropForC/blob/master/DATA%20USE%20POLICY.md).

##Contributing to the database: 
We anticipate that ForC-db will be of great value for various initiatives seeking to understand and manage the role of tropical forests in the global C cycle, and we encourage authors to contribute data. Please see `CONTRIBUTING.md`(https://github.com/forc-db/TropForC/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
