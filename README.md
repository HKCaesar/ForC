##Database overview:
The Tropical Forest C database (**TropForC-db**) is the tropical component of ForC-db, which is a global C database that is currently under development and maintained at https://github.com/forc-db, where a more
recent version may be available. The database consists of a series of cross-referenced data tables describing
(1) sites, (2) plots and their history, (3) measurements of C cycle variables, (4) variables, (5) disturbance/history event type, (6) plant functional types (PFTs)/ species, (7) methodology, and (8)
allometries. A full description of the database and metaadata for all tables is given in `readme_TropForC.pdf`. Data were obtained from multiple previous compilations and individual published studies, as detailed in Anderson-Teixeira et al. (2016). Original citations associated with all data are given in the
measurements table (3), and full citations are in the file `TropForC_bibliography.pdf`. Sample R code, showing how to load the data files into R and join the tables, is provided in a separate file, named
`TropForC_Rcode.txt`.
