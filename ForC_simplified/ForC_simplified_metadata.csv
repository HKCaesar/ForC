1 / A,MEASUREMENTS,measurement.ID,Unique identifier for each record in the measurements table.,numeric (integer),-,-
2 / B,MEASUREMENTS,sites.sitename,"Unique site identifier name for the site at which the measurement was made. Links to SITES, PLOTS and HISTORY tables. ",character (string),-,-
3 / C,MEASUREMENTS,plot.name,Unique plot identifier name for the plot in which the measurement was made. Links to HISTORY and PLOTS table.,character (string),-,-
4 / D,MEASUREMENTS,stand.age,"Age of stand at time of measurement as reported in the original publication or calculated based on the date of initiation of forest regrowth. When the publication reports a range of ages, the mean is recorded. For stands that were reported as primary/old-growth/mature/ intact stands, the stand.age is recorded as ""999"". WARNING: The ""999"" designation may include some older secondary stands that were designated ""mature"" or some partially disturbed primary stands (e.g., partially logged).",numeric (double),see description,years
5 / E,MEASUREMENTS,dominant.life.form,"Dominant life form at time of measurement, with categories including ""woody"" (trees, seedlings, or shrubs), ""grass"", and ""woody+grass"" (i.e., savanna). ",character (string),see description,-
6 / F,MEASUREMENTS,dominant.veg,"Code used to identify plant functional type of dominant vegetation at time of measurement. For trees, groupings are based on leaf type (broadleaf /needleleaf/ mixed) and phenology (deciduous/ evergreen/ mixed), and dominance is defined based on an 80% threshold (if given). If vegetation is a mix of trees and other vegetation, codes refer to the functional type of trees. For vegetation with no significant tree species component, groupings are by life form, if any.

16 / P,MEASUREMENTS,mean,Mean value of measurement recorded. Units dependent on variable.name. ,numeric (double) ,-,Given in VARIABLES table
20 / T,MEASUREMENTS,area.sampled,"Area sampled for measurement of the particular variable. If the measurement includes multiple components with different sampling area (e.g., large trees sampled in the entire plot, small trees sampled in subplots), the largest area is reported. This may be less than plot.area (PLOTS table). As this field was added after most of the data had been entered, it is coded as ""NAC"" for most records.",numeric (double),-,ha
25 / Y,MEASUREMENTS,min.dbh,"Minimum diameter (typically DBH, diameter at breast height) of tree stems included in the measurement. ""0"" indicates that all stems were included.",numeric (integer),,cm
26 / Z,MEASUREMENTS,depth,Depth of measurement if belowground or including belowground components,numeric (integer),-,cm
27 / AA,MEASUREMENTS,covariate_1,Code name for covariate associated with the variable being measured. Codes defined in VARIABLES table.,character (string),-,-
